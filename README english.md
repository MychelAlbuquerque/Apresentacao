# Hire me (Presentation page)

This was a project to put into practice learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It is a simple page but which has presentation, portfolio sample and some other detailed functions below. As I advance in the studies, I will implement more options and correcting what is necessary.:D

The page can be easily accessed through the link: https://mychelalbuquerque.github.io/mychel/

If you are interested in clone the repository and run directly on your machine to analyze the code and perform tests can follow this step by step:

1 - On the main repository page click the "Code" green button, then use the "Download Zip" option
2 - After extracting the files, you can open the "index.html" file directly in your browser.
